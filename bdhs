    feat: Remove unused TargetEntity import
    
    The `TargetEntity` type was imported but not used within the `KataCannonGame` component. Removing this import cleans up the code and reduces potential confusion.

    fix: Simplify sound effect handling
    
    Remove unused type parameters and simplify the playSound function to a no-op. The audio playback logic is currently mocked and not intended to be functional. This change cleans up the code by removing unnecessary complexity.

    refactor: Remove unused currentLevel from RoundManager
    
    The `_currentLevel` property was initialized and then immediately overwritten within the `generateRound` method, making it redundant. This commit removes the unused property for cleaner code.

    refactor: Improve round generation logic
    
    Update `RoundManager` to use a private member `_currentLevel` for better encapsulation.
    Modify `createTargetsFromRound` to ignore `canvasHeight` as it's not used.
    Adjust `playSound` parameter to `_type` as the sound functionality is currently mocked.

    feat: Rename game route to arcade
    
    The game feature has been renamed from "/game" to "/arcade" to better reflect its nature as a supplementary learning tool within the application. This change updates navigation links, routing, and internal references to reflect the new path.

    feat: Use Vite environment variables for API key
    
    Updates the deck details page to correctly load the Gemini API key from Vite's environment variables (`VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`). This replaces the previous usage of `process.env.API_KEY`, which is not compatible with Vite's build process.
    
    Includes type definitions for the new environment variable in `vite-env.d.ts`.

    feat: Use global NodeJS ProcessEnv for API_KEY
    
    Updates the environment type declaration to properly use the global `NodeJS.ProcessEnv` interface. This ensures type safety when accessing environment variables like `API_KEY` in a Node.js context.

    feat: Configure path aliases and update imports
    
    Introduces path aliases in tsconfig.json to simplify module imports and improve project structure. Updates import paths across various files to leverage these new aliases, ensuring consistency and maintainability. Also adds Node types to devDependencies.

    feat: Implement deck import functionality
    
    Adds a new `Import` page and associated module to allow users to import card data from JSON files into existing decks. This feature enhances data management and allows for bulk card additions.
    
    Changes include:
    - Creating the `Import` page component and its logic for parsing JSON and selecting a target deck.
    - Modifying the `Decks` page to potentially integrate with import features (though not directly in this commit's visible diff).
    - Ensuring proper validation of imported JSON data and card structure.

    feat: Integrate Google Generative AI and refine game
    
    Adds the `@google/genai` dependency to enable future AI integrations.
    
    Refactors the game component by removing unused imports and console logs, and slightly adjusting projectile color logic. Enhances UI by removing the redundant `XCircle` icon from the HUD. Also, cleans up unused imports in `GameCanvas` and removes a commented-out `refreshData` function in `Decks.tsx`.
    
    Introduces `NodeJS.ProcessEnv` type definition for environment variables.

    feat: Migrate to new entry point and update dependencies
    
    The application entry point has been moved from `src/index.tsx` to `src/main.tsx`. This change also includes updating dependencies in `index.html` to reflect the new structure and to include the `@google/genai` package.
    
    Additionally, the `src/types.ts` file has been deprecated as its contents have been moved to `src/modules/decks/model.ts`.
    
    Storage logic in `utils/storage.ts` has been refactored to simplify card retrieval and remove unused deck storage keys. The `Dashboard` and `Study` pages have been updated to reflect these changes, including removing unused state and icons.
